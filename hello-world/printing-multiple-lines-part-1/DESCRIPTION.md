### Printing multiple lines

You may remember the `\n` from the first Hello World challenge. When using the `printf` to display output, the `\n` prints out a newline - like if you hit the Enter key. You can include as many `\n`'s as you'd like in each `printf` statement, you can also use as many `printf`'s as you want!

In this challenge, your goal is to print out two separate lines of text, using two separate `printf` statements. Refer back to the first challenge for more information about using `printf`!

### Challenge instructions
Follow these steps to complete the challenge!
 
1. Make sure you still have your "Hello World!" C file in your home directory.
2. Reopen that file (or create a new file if you prefer), and edit it to print the expected two lines of output below. Your code must use two separate `printf` statements, one for each line of output. 
3. To test your program, compile and run it to see the output.
4. To get the flag, run `/challenge/verify <your_file>.c` (replacing `<your_file>` with the name of your C file) to validate your solution. 

Expected output:
```
Hello World!
Goodbye World!
```
