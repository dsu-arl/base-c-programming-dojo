### Challenge instructions
Follow these steps to complete the challenge!

1. (Optional) Make sure you still have your "Hello World!" C file in your home directory.
2. Reopen that file (or create a new file if you prefer), and edit it to print the following two lines of output. Your code must use _one_ single `printf` statement to print both lines.
```
Hello World!
Goodbye World!
```
3. To test your program, compile and run it to see the output.
4. To get the flag, run `verify <your_file>.c` (replacing `<your_file>` with the name of your C file) to validate your solution.
